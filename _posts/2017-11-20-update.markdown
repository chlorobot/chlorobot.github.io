Running the lights within the cabinet caused dry, arid heat that probably wasn't ideal especially for seedlings.

With the help of a friend and a rotary tool we were able to trim a hole in the top of the cabinet for the light
to rest atop.

Temperature and humidity within the cabinet are now much more controllable with the top fan and the plants appear
to be extremely happy.

I've now added 1/4" sheathing to all sensor wiring to couple both temp/RH as well as UV and motor power cables.

Home depot sells some 1/2" 'misting' fittings which happen to work perfectly with my 12v 0.7A water pump.  
I'm still searching for a reservoir that will fit along the back wall of the cabinet.

Next up is finishing the mains relay controller and figuring out a way to house the electronics.
