I received a few goodies in the mail today.
Most exciting I think would probably be the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01G8AXP48/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=15121&creative=330641&creativeASIN=B01G8AXP48&linkCode=as2&tag=chlorobot-20&linkId=50e1667706d9e561ca808204844ffed9">VIPARSPECTRA Reflector-Series 300W LED Grow Light Full Spectrum for Indoor Plants Veg and Flower</a><img src="//ir-ca.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=chlorobot-20&l=am2&o=15&a=B01G8AXP48" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

I simply wasn't happy with the 'cheap' 45 watt blue/red LED and thought I'd upgrade to something a little more powerful.
This thing is **bright** - I mean really bright and I'm excited to see how it performs. I'm going to hang on to the 45 watt
LED to determine if it at all helps when I grow other things.

The second item to arrive was a week late despite paying for expedited shipping, thanks Purolator...

The internet says these mats can hasten germination time by a factor of 2, I'm skeptical but why not give it a go for $30.
Once again, this product appears to be well built, I assume it's a simple coil in there so probably not much to it /me crosses fingers.

Lastly I received a four module relay - turns out the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/2935" target="_blank">Controllable Four Outlet Power Relay Module version 2</a> I bought from Adafruit
is neutered in functionality as it's simply a single control relay with XOR across three of the four plugs. I should have done more research before buying this one.

I'm kinda nervous about working with mains electricity, I'll continue to do my research before plugging this 110v box into the wall.

<em>Turning the fan on when temperature <= 23&deg;C

I decided a nice reliable power source for the exhaust fans and 12v water pump would probably be an ATX power supply.
I pulled this beauty out of the bin at work, found the pinout and shorted the PWR_ON with GND - it's overkill at 500w but it was also free.

That's it for tonight, I should be receiving the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B06WRTX42Y/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=15121&creative=330641&creativeASIN=B06WRTX42Y&linkCode=as2&tag=chlorobot-20&linkId=de87af29e61faf3bcba01c4ec8b54852">Asiahorse 120mm Cooling PC fans</a><img src="//ir-ca.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=chlorobot-20&l=am2&o=15&a=B06WRTX42Y" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
tomorrow at which point I should be able to install my pretty new lighting system.
