I wanted to share my first attempt soldering on a chip - I had to borrow my sons eye-glasses for this one.

Secondly I've decided since internal temperatures are far too high I'd find a way to cut a square atop the fridge
in order to have the light heat sinks and vents outside of the unit.  This not only increases grow space but also
decreases the temperature substantially.

I've also soldered both DHT11 temp/RH sensors to long wires both functional and attached to the Pi.

I will update with pictures after my birthday dinner.
