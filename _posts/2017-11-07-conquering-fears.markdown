### A Quick update

I've been rather timid to hook up my new 300w light to the mains relay system - as a matter of fact
I was considering a friend help me rig this up as I didn't trust myself to do it correctly.

After spending a lot of time researching electrical safety and how to deal with high voltage I finally
said "just get it over with", strapped on my rubber gloves and rigged up a **functional**
relay to control all four of my high voltage outputs [lights, heat mat, PSU, aerator].

Here's a short video demonstrating a simple thing that happens to be a big deal to me

PS: Today I learned not how <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/GFCI" target="_blank">GFCI</a> (already knew that), but **why** GFCI.

Next steps :
* Enclusure for electronics
* Removing some reflective tape to hang the new light
